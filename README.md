# NEXUS AI ‚Äì Universal Web Intelligence Navigator

## üöÄ Revolutionary Autonomous Web Agent

NEXUS AI is a cutting-edge autonomous web navigation system that can intelligently browse any website, analyze products, gather news, and provide human-like interaction with the web.

## Project Title & Summary

- Project Title: `NEXUS-AI` (matches the GitHub repository name)

Project Summary (‚â§300 words):
NEXUS AI addresses the challenge of extracting useful information from diverse, ever-changing websites without site-specific integrations. It understands natural-language queries and autonomously navigates pages using human-like behaviors‚Äîscrolling, clicking, waiting, retrying‚Äîand structured extraction. The prototype combines a Node.js backend with Playwright‚Äëdriven automation and a lightweight real-time UI to show progress and results. It supports common tasks such as product comparison, news summarization, and cross‚Äësite analysis while remaining configurable via `config.json`.

The proposed solution uses site adapters for major platforms (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart, Google, news portals) and generic fallbacks for arbitrary sites. A summarization and analysis layer transforms raw page data into concise insights. Voice interaction (Web Speech API) enables natural command-and-response operation. Error resilience and adaptive delays improve reliability and mimic real-user behavior.

Uniqueness and impact: Unlike static scrapers or single‚Äësite bots, NEXUS AI is a universal navigator designed to generalize across sites and tasks. Its modular adapters, autonomous decision-making, and voice interface make it accessible and scalable for research, shopping, and news intelligence. By prioritizing local execution and consent, it balances capability with privacy and responsible automation.

## Problem Statement

## üìå Problem Statement

Design and implement an autonomous web agent that can understand natural‚Äëlanguage queries and navigate arbitrary websites to retrieve, analyze, and summarize information (e.g., products, articles, comparisons) with minimal human supervision.

## üß≠ Proposal & Prototype Plan

- Phase 1: Core Setup
  - Establish Node.js backend (Express + WebSocket) and Playwright with Chromium.
  - Baseline frontend with real‚Äëtime status and logs.
- Phase 2: Autonomous Navigation
  - Implement human‚Äëlike actions: scrolling, clicking, waiting, retries, error recovery.
  - Site adapters for major platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Google, News sites).
- Phase 3: Analysis & Summarization
  - Product spec extraction, review parsing, and scoring.
  - Article content extraction and concise summaries.
- Phase 4: Voice Interaction
  - Integrate Web Speech API for voice commands and responses.
- Phase 5: Evaluation & Telemetry
  - Structured logs, optional screenshots, and performance metrics.
  - Configurable behaviors via `config.json`.

## üß∞ Tech Stack Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express, WebSocket
- Automation: Playwright + Chromium
- Frontend: HTML5 with real‚Äëtime updates
- Voice: Web Speech API
- Config: JSON‚Äëbased (`config.json`)
