# NEXUS AI ‚Äì The Intelligent Web Navigator That Thinks Like You  

Unlike traditional chatbots that only provide answers, **NEXUS AI goes a step further**: it **autonomously browses websites, searches for products or news, and analyzes content in real-time**‚Äîall while **mimicking human behavior**. Scrolls, clicks, waits, retries, and adapts like a real person navigating the web.  

Ask it to compare laptops, fetch the latest news, or analyze products across multiple platforms, and Nexus AI will open the browser, navigate pages intelligently, and present structured insights. It‚Äôs **not just a chatbot; it‚Äôs your personal web intelligence assistant**‚Äîuniversal, autonomous, and highly adaptable.

## üöÄ Project Title & Summary

**Project Title:** `NEXUS-AI`  

**Project Summary:**  
NEXUS AI is an autonomous web navigation system designed to intelligently browse any website, analyze products, gather news, and provide human-like interaction. It addresses the challenge of extracting useful information from diverse, dynamic websites without requiring site-specific integrations. Users can input natural-language queries, and NEXUS AI navigates pages autonomously‚Äîscrolling, clicking, waiting, and retrying‚Äîto retrieve structured insights.

The prototype integrates a Node.js backend with Playwright for browser automation and a lightweight real-time frontend. It supports common tasks such as product comparison, news summarization, and cross-platform analysis. Voice interaction via the Web Speech API enables natural command-and-response operation. Error resilience, adaptive delays, and site adapters for major platforms ensure reliability and scalability.

**Uniqueness & Impact:**  
Unlike conventional scrapers or bots limited to specific sites, NEXUS AI generalizes across multiple websites and tasks. Its modular architecture, autonomous decision-making, and voice interface make it an innovative solution for research, shopping, and news intelligence, all while prioritizing local execution and user privacy.

## üß≠ Proposal & Prototype Plan

**Phase 1: Core Setup**  
- Node.js backend (Express + WebSocket) and Playwright with Chromium.  
- Basic frontend with real-time status and logs.

**Phase 2: Autonomous Navigation**  
- Human-like browsing actions: scrolling, clicking, waiting, retries, error recovery.  
- Site adapters for major platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Google, news sites).

**Phase 3: Analysis & Summarization**  
- Product specification extraction, review parsing, and scoring.  
- Article content extraction and concise summaries.

**Phase 4: Voice Interaction**  
- Integration with Web Speech API for natural voice commands and responses.

**Phase 5: Evaluation & Telemetry**  
- Structured logs, optional screenshots, and performance metrics.  
- Configurable behaviors via `config.json`.
