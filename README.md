🤖 NEXUS AI – The Intelligent Web Navigator That Thinks Like You 🌐

Unlike traditional chatbots that simply provide answers, NEXUS AI goes further: it autonomously browses websites, searches for products or news, and analyzes content in real-time, all while mimicking human behavior. It scrolls, clicks, waits, retries, and adapts just like a real person navigating the web.

Ask it to compare laptops 💻, fetch the latest news 📰, or analyze products across multiple platforms 🛒, and NEXUS AI will intelligently navigate pages and present structured insights. It’s not just a chatbot; it’s your personal web intelligence assistant—universal, autonomous, and highly adaptable.

🚀 Project Title & Summary

Project Title: NEXUS-AI

Project Summary:
NEXUS AI is an autonomous web browser and intelligent assistant that opens links directly, navigates websites like a human, and fetches structured insights in real-time. Unlike conventional browsers or chatbots that rely on static responses, NEXUS AI autonomously scrolls, clicks, waits, retries, and adapts to any website or query. Users can input natural-language commands to compare products, fetch news, or analyze content, and NEXUS AI handles the entire process without manual intervention. Its human-like behavior, voice interaction 🎤, and cross-platform adaptability make it the future of chatbots and web automation. By combining real-time analysis with autonomous navigation, NEXUS AI transforms how people interact with the web, research information, and make decisions—all while maintaining privacy and local execution 🔒.

📌 Problem Statement

Design and implement an autonomous web agent that can understand natural-language queries and navigate arbitrary websites to retrieve, analyze, and summarize information (e.g., products, articles, comparisons) with minimal human supervision.
